### Database Schema

![Responsive view](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmhdrvehj/image/upload/v1715736668/database-schema_svcmsn.png)

1. User: The User model is part of Django Allauth. The model comes with predefined fields as standard. Some of them are username, email, password, and more. This model is used for user authentication, hence why changes directly to this model are not advisory. The User model is connected to the UserProfile model with one to one relationship.

2. UserProfile: The UserProfile model is a custom custom-created model to handle the user profile details. Signals are used to reflect the changes between the User and UserProfile models.

3. Category: This model was created for the purpose of defining categories for the products

4. Product: This is a custom product model. It is connected to Genre.

5. Order: This model holds all the information of the user's order. It is connected to the UserProfile as a ForeignKey.

6. OrderLineItem This model is connected to the Order and Product as a ForeignKey. It is created for each item in the order
7. ProductVariant: This model is connected with shoe size and stock for each size.

### Fonts

In addition to Bootstrap 4 built in font family the below two fonts were used throughout the application

Indie Flower

### Agile Methodology

#### Overview

This project was created using agile principles. As this is my second full-stack project, using agile, it was easier to identify the relevant milestones. Using the agile approach allowed me to plan all the features of the website through user stories. Each user story has acceptance criteria and tasks to clearly outline the requirements for each feature to be completed.

#### Epics(Milestones)

The user stories are grouped into eight EPICS or Milestones. An additional Milestone called Project Backlog was created to manage any additional features, bugs, or tasks that may arise during development.

#### User Stories Issues

The structure of the user story issue consists of the user story, acceptance criteria, and tasks that outline the steps that are required for this issue to be completed. During development where possible, the commit messages are connected to their corresponding issues.

#### MoSCoW prioritization

This prioritization technique was used to effectively prioritize the features and requirements of the project based on their importance. The acronym "MoSCoW" stands for "Must have, Should have, Could have, and Won't have." Each category helps categorize and prioritize features to guide the development process and ensure that the most critical elements are addressed first.

#### GitHub Projects

The project was created using a basic Kanban Board structure, divided into columns such as Todo, In Progress, Done, and Backlog. This setup provides a clear and organized way to track the status of tasks and visualize and manage the workflow.
